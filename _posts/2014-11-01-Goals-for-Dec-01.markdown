### Monday

* Slotted Aloha
* Monte Carlo Efficiency Simulation
  * After we have done an overview of slotted aloha you will write a simulation to determine which probability gives us maximum use of the channel for different group sizes.  This is a good exercise in "programming to learn" and is surely more fun than taking a derivative.
  

### Wednesday

* Regular Aloha and 
* CSMA, CSMA/CD
* DOCSIS - Cable Internet

### Friday

* Wireless Link Layer Protocols
* 802.11
