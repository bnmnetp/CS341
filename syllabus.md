Text Book

Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach by Kurose and Ross

Computer Networking is intended to give you an introduction to the Architecture, Algorithms, 
and Protocols used by the network that we know as the Internet. The internet may very well be 
the greatest achievement ever as far as a software engineering project goes. By the time the 
class is over you may well think it a miracle that you can display a webpage in your browser.

Goals
=====

-  To learn and understand the key protocols used by the Internet for wired as well as wireless devices, including cell phones.
-  To appreciate the layered architecture that the Internet relies upon. Including the contracts that each layer has with its neighbors.
-  To understand the key algorithms used by each of the network layers.
-  To be able to write application level network programs

Anti-Goals
==========

- You will not learn how to configure your home router - but you will understand what the settings mean.
- You will not learn advanced Cisco technologies
- You will not learn how to break through firewalls and hack into systems

  1. Ethernet
6.  Wireless and Mobile Networks
  1. CDMA
  1. WiFi -- 802.11 protocols


Notes
=====

-  Programming can be notoriously time consuming. Budget your time and start your projects 
early to avoid frustration with deadlines.
-  Yes, you will have to use Math in this class. Basic statistics and algebra. I may even do a 
derivative at some point. But, I’m probably more math phobic than you so don’t worry.
- You will use iPython to turn do your homework. You will turn in the notebook katie.
- You will need to run wireshark with "root access" for several assignments.  You can likely do that from your own computer running Windows, OS X, or Linux. 
- Always feel free to ask questions.
- It is almost inevitable that technical problems will occur. When they do, please have 
patience and don't panic.

Class Requirements: 
===================

Participation
-------------

“The teacher’s job is to design learning experiences, not primarily to
impart information” This is going to be an experiential class, I’ll
lecture some and try to explain some big picture stuff but, I’ve learned
everything I know in this area by doing stuff. I expect you to be
engaged and to ask questions and do stuff. If you stop at the bare
minimum of what I ask you to do for any particular assignment you’ll be
missing an opportunity.

Homework
--------

You will have at least weekly homework assignments, sometimes more
frequently when they are easier.


Grading
-------

    20%   Homework Assignments
    30%   Programming Projects
    40%   Exams
    10%   Class participation

The grading scale is:

    90 -- 100   A
    80 -- 89    B
    70 -- 79    C
    60 -- 69    D
    0 --  59    F
