Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach by Kurose and Ross

Computer Networking is intended to give you an introduction to the Architecture, Algorithms, 
and Protocols used by the network that we know as the Internet. The internet may very well be 
the greatest achievement ever as far as a software engineering project goes. By the time the 
class is over you may well think it a miracle that you can display a webpage in your browser.

Goals
=====

-  To learn and understand the key protocols used by the Internet for wired as well as wireless devices, including cell phones.
-  To appreciate the layered architecture that the Internet relies upon. Including the contracts that each layer has with its neighbors.
-  To understand the key algorithms used by each of the network layers.
-  To be able to write application level network programs

Anti-Goals
==========

- You will not learn how to configure your home router - but you will understand what the settings mean.
- You will not learn advanced Cisco technologies
- You will not learn how to break through firewalls and hack into systems

Course Outline
==============

1.  Computer Networks and the Internet

  1. Packet Switched Networks
  1. Delay, Loss, and throughput
  1. Overview of the Network Layers

2.  The Application Layer

  1. The Web and HTTP
  1. DNS Overview
  1. Socket Programming
  

3.  The Transport Layer

  1. Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
  1. Reliable Data Transfer
  1. TCP
  1. Congestion Control

4.  The Network Layer

  1. Forwarding and Routing
  1. the IP protococol
  1. Routing Algorithms
  1. Broadcast and Multicast
  
5.  The Link Layer

  1. Error Detection and Correction
  1. Multiple Access Links and Protocols
  1. Ethernet

6.  Wireless and Mobile Networks

  1. CDMA
  1. WiFi -- 802.11 protocols


Notes
=====

-  Programming can be notoriously time consuming. Budget your time and start your projects 
early to avoid frustration with deadlines.
-  Yes, you will have to use Math in this class. Basic statistics and algebra. I may even do a 
derivative at some point. But, I’m probably more math phobic than you so don’t worry.
- You will use iPython to turn do your homework. You will turn in the notebook katie.
- You will need to run wireshark with "root access" for several assignments.  You can likely do that from your own computer running Windows, OS X, or Linux. 
- Always feel free to ask questions.
- It is almost inevitable that technical problems will occur. When they do, please have 
patience and don't panic.

Class Requirements: 
===================

Participation
-------------

“The teacher’s job is to design learning experiences, not primarily to
impart information” This is going to be an experiential class, I’ll
lecture some and try to explain some big picture stuff but, I’ve learned
everything I know in this area by doing stuff. I expect you to be
engaged and to ask questions and do stuff. If you stop at the bare
minimum of what I ask you to do for any particular assignment you’ll be
missing an opportunity.

Homework
--------

You will have at least weekly homework assignments, sometimes more
frequently when they are easier.

Midterm Mashups

The mid-term mashup will be a substantial part of your grade. You will
need to design and implement a mashup, then you’ll present a demo of it
to the class when it is all done. Many of today’s successful web
businesses started out as simple mashups. If you desire you can work
with one other person on the mid-term.

-   Create a web page/pages that utilize one or more Web APIs

-   Built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML

-   Examples of available APIs

-   Google Documents, Maps, Calendar, etc.

-   Twitter, Facebook

-   Amazon, Evernote, Dropbox, RTM, tweedledo

-   Movies, Music, Books, ...

-   1000’s of others

-   Combine one or more of these web services to create your own cool
    service

Final Project
-------------

Later in the semester you will need to devise a final project. This
project will make use of the web development framework we’ve used in
class, or you could venture out and use one of the many other web
frameworks (Django, Ruby on Rails, Groovy on Grails, Google App Engine,
etc.) You can work in a group of up to 3. You will need to write up a
formal proposal for this project and have it approved by me before
starting. You and your group will present the project to the class in
the last week of the course.

Grading
-------

    20%   Homework Assignments
    30%   Programming Projects
    40%   Exams
    10%   Class participation

The grading scale is:

    90 -- 100   A
    80 -- 89    B
    70 -- 79    C
    60 -- 69    D
    0 --  59    F
